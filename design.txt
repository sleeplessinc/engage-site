Typing "..." indicator when people are typing.

	@JoeAnderson is your site dedicated to certain type of SE claims?
	suggestion: IL types in claim first along with their name, that becomes conversation title.
		then the SE conductor can be added in
		like: ayylien on The belief in the existence of God

Timestamps

Add option on talk page that IL can use to register to be notified when an SE
becomes available. (service worker notice, email notice options?)

New visual design, less plain and business like; add graphics/faces?

Avoid the SE/IL abbreviations in copy.

Make sure talk page fits everything on screen
Make the chat vertically fill the page so it does not require so much scrolling.

Fix button appearance on mobile safari

Add a message that talk can be bookmarked
Maybe link copy button?

Find out if the localStorage data is being lost on mobile too easily.

Engage
===============================

User Experience
-----------------

	User visits home page

	Page shows:

		Welcome to SE Engage!
		Click "Engage Now" if you'd like to be interviewed by an SE.

		[ Engage Now ]

	User clicks, page changes to:

		What belief would you like to have challenged?

		< FREE FORM TEXT BOX >

		[ Submit ]

	User enters "i believe in god", clicks Submit, page changes to:

		Stand by while an SE is summoned to engage with you ...

		[ Cancel ]
	
	Clicking cancel returns to home page

	If 30 seconds elapse while waiting, this appears:

		Sorry, no SE's available right now. Try later
	
	... otherwise page changes a basic chat window view;

		An SE has been located and is ready to interview you!
		Note: Conversation will be recorded.

		+--------------------------------------------------+
		| SE: Hi, my name is Betty.  I'll be your SE today.
		| SE: It says you belive in god?
		|
		| IL: yes jesus died for my sins
		|
		| SE: Okay let's talk about that ...
		| ....
		+--------------------------------------------------+

	A standard, simple text-chat ensues.


Under the covers:
-----------------
	
	The "wait for an SE" process involves the page sending out notifications to
	people on a list who've volunteered to participate.  The first SE to engage
	is then allowed to converse with the IL.  Others can go to the conversation
	page, but will only be able to lurk.

	Each conversation page will have a unique URL so that it can be bookmarked.
	The SE and IL can then return to that page anytime to continue their talk
	if they want.

	The entire conversation is carefully logged/stored so that it can be used 
	for research or reference purposes.  [1]

	The data will be store in a database with unique identifiers for each
	conversation between a given SE and a given IL. Each chat entry will be
	stored as being from either the SE or the IL so they can be clearly 
	distinguished.


Possible Future additions
---------------------------

	Button to download the chat.

	Ability to request specific SEs?

	If Joe's ML experimentation is fruitful, the SE might see help in the form
	of tags/flags, like "IL says they 'grew up that way'", or "IL mentioned faith"
	along with hints, like "Apply the OTF", or "Ask IL for their own definition of faith", etc.

	Interviews can be stored and indexed simply as reference material in transcript form,
	or published on the transcripts page of SE site.



[1] Joe is particularly interested in the recorded convo because he wants to use
    it for working with machine-learning that can recognize logical fallacies and other
	kinds of IL responses.
